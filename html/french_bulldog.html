            In at number 3 is the distinctive Frenchie, small in stature but with a big personality! This fun-loving
            breed is happiest when in close and regular contact with their humans and can suffer from separation
            anxiety if left alone for too long. Their exercise needs are minimal - although a short daily walk is
            recommended, making them a good fit for apartment dwellers. As they can be prone to heat stroke, care must
            be taken while exercising in hot and humid weather- early mornings and late evenings are best in Summer.

            The Frenchie is renowned for their patience and affection towards their owners and are particularly
            tolerant of children. Did you know that the French Bulldog flirted with extinction in the post - World War 1
            era and were considered an extremely rare breed? Thankfully, they made it and we still have all that
            awesome cuteness today. Grace a Dieu! (Even though they’re not actually French…sssshhh!)
