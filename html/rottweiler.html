            Another breed once considered among the ‘bad boys’, the Rottie has an impressive physical stature that
            belies a heart of gold. With a heritage said to include guarding the livestock of the Roman legions and
            driving cattle to market, they are a powerful and athletic specimen. For this reason, they have often been
            chosen to portray vicious attack dogs in movies and on TV, contributing to some people’s negative
            perception of them. In reality, they are calm, good-natured and devoted to their family. They can be
            aloof with strangers, waiting to make sure that there is no threat to their family before making friends.
            If a threat is posed, their fierce loyalty will ensure their fearless protection but a well-raised
            Rottweiler is never aggressive without reason. It’s important to start training and socialisation early,
            as they can be a dominant dog who assumes they’re the master of the house! However, firm and consistent
            training routines will develop a physical beast of a dog who’s just a beauty at heart. They respond best
            to positive reinforcement - harsh discipline can result in them losing respect for their human as pack leader.

            Rotties should get plenty of physical exercise to burn up their energy and satisfy their drive to work.
            They’re chewers so, if bored, their powerful jaws can reduce household items to rubble in minutes! Did
            you know? Despite their media portrayal, Rottweilers are steadily gaining a reputation as an excellent
            dog for use in therapy work.
