        When it comes to feeding your dog, there are some decisions you need to make. Proper nutrition is one of your
        dog's basic needs, and it's about more than just the brand of dog food. Check out the answers to some basic
        questions many dog owners have about have about feeding.
    </p>
    </section>

    <h2>What Type of Dog Food is Best for My Dog ?</h2>
    <p>
        Because there are so many commercial dog food brands available, choosing a dog food can be quite overwhelming.
        All commercial diets with the <strong>AAFCO(Association of American Feed Control Officials)</strong> label are
        considered "complete and balanced" for dogs. This means that the diet sustains life and meets a dog's basic
        nutritional needs. However, not all dog foods are created equal. Many experts agree that the quality of
        ingredients plays a major role in a dog's health and well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Choosing Commercial Diets:</b> To compare foods and determine which is best for your dog, talk to your
        veterinarian first. Ask for input from dog professionals and even other dog owners. Do your own research on
        sites like <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/">DogFoodAdvisor.com</a>. When in doubt, ask your vet for
        a referral to a veterinary nutritionist. Remember that opinions on canine nutrition tend to vary greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Choosing Home-Prepared Diets:</b> Rather than choosing a commercial diet, some owners opt to go for homemade
        diets. If you try this option, make sure you work with your veterinarian to create a complete and balanced diet
        that is customized for your dog's needs. To begin developing a home-prepared diet for your dog, check out
        <a href="https://secure.balanceit.com/recipegenerator_ver4/index.php?rotator=EZ">BalanceIt.com</a> and/or
        <a href="https://www.petdiets.com/">PetDiets.com</a>. Failure to feed a complete and balanced diet can lead
        to major health problems for your dog.
    </p>
    <h2>How Much Food Should I Feed My Dog ?</h2>
    <p>
        The amount of food to feed your dog depends on a few factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog's age (puppy vs. adult)</li>
        <li>Your dog's body condition</li>
        <li>Your dog's activity level</li>
        <li>The calorie and nutrient content of the diet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <a href="http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-feeding-tips/dog-food-calculator/">dog food calculator</a> can tell
        you approximately how many calories per day your dog needs. Talk to your vet about your dog's body condition
        and ideal weight.
    </p>
    <h2>How Often Does My Dog Need to Eat ?</h2>
    <p>
        Most experts agree that twice-daily feeding is best for most adult dogs. Once-a-day is a long time for a dog to
        go between meals. Puppies should be fed 3-6 times per day (small puppies need food more often to prevent low
        blood sugar). Talk to your vet about an appropriate feeding schedule for your dog.
    </p>
    <h2>What Type of Dog Bowl Is Best ?</h2>
    <p>
        Experts recommend avoiding plastic bowls for a dog's food and water. This is because your dog can develop an
        allergic reaction or sensitivity, resulting in a rash or type of acne on the chin and face. Not only is the
        plastic a potential irritant, but the bowl may harbor bacteria or other microbes that affect your dog. Plastic
        bowls are harder to keep clean because of microscopic nooks and crannied where germs can live. It's best to use
        metal or ceramic bowls for dog food and water.
    </p>
    <h2>What About Dog Treats ?</h2>
    <p>
        There are plenty of options for yummy <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-treat-varieties-1118462">dog
        treats</a> and <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-the-best-dog-chews-1118607">dog chews</a>.
        Make sure to choose safe options for your dog. Also, remember that treats and chews are supplements to your
        dog's diet and should never make up more than about 10% of your dog's daily caloric intake.
    </p>
    <h2>What Foods Should I Avoid Feeding ?</h2>
    <p>
        Most dogs love food and will eat just about anything they can find. Avoid the following <b>harmful</b> or
        even <b>toxic</b> foods for dogs:<br><br> Chocolate ;Grapes/Raisins; Onions; Pits and seeds from
        fruits/vegetables; Alcoholic drinks or foods; Caffeinated drinks or foods; Macadamia nuts; Yeast dough;
        Xylitol (found in sugar-free or reduced-sugar gum and candy); Moldy or rotten food; Fatty foods; Salty foods;
        Bones, antlers and animal hooves. More details, please see
        <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/toxic-foods-and-your-dog-1117869">Food that never feed your dog</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>What Human Foods are Safe for Dogs ?</h2>
    <p>
        While people food should generally be avoided, there are some that you can safely feed as treats or with meals
        to make dog food more palatable. Unseasoned lean meats and certain plain fruits and vegetables are healthy for
        dogs. Opt for whole, unprocessed foods low in fat, salt, and sugar. Feed small portions as treats, remembering
        the rule about treats making up no more than 10% of your dog's daily intake. Here are some <b>healthy</b>
        options for dogs:<br><br> Chicken; Turkey; Beef; Carrots; Green beans; Sweet potatoes; Apples; Bananas;
