            Originating in Germany, the Miniature Schnauzer came to be when the standard variety was bred will smaller
            dogs to create a breed that was skilled at hunting rats on farms. These are a spirited little dog who are
            alert and active, with a great degree of curiosity. Very independent, they can vary greatly from individual
            to individual so it can be difficult to predict your puppy’s personality! Some exhibit high-energy,
            terrier-like traits while others can be much calmer. However, they will all have that distinctive
            appearance, with long leg hair, bushy eyebrows and an impressive moustache! Maybe that’s what gives them
            their confidence as they’ve no problem swaggering up to a much bigger dog and standing their ground -
            sometimes getting themselves into trouble! A keen watchdog, they will alert you to any unfamiliar
            visitors and are generally suspicious of strangers.

            Their intelligence means that they can be easily trained but bear in mind they can also be extremely
            stubborn, sometimes pretending not to hear you! Let these guys get away with something once and they’re
            likely to remember it forever, making it difficult to change the behaviour. However, their favourite
            thing is spending time with their owner so, provided you keep them mentally stimulated and give them a
            moderate amount of exercise, they’re a fantastic companion and guaranteed to make you laugh!
