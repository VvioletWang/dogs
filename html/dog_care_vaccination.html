    <h1>Core and Non-core Vaccinations</h1>
    <p>
        There are two types of vaccinations: <a href="#core">Core</a> and <a href="#non-core">Non-core</a>.
        Veterinarians recommend core vaccinations to battle such diseases as rabies and canine distemper. These
        ailments are extremely infectious and can pose a threat to a dog's life. Not only do core vaccinations protect
        the animals, but they also protect humans. Non-core vaccinations include those for kennel cough (Bordetella),
        Lyme disease, parainfluenza, among others. Non-core vaccinations are only administered on an "as needed basis."
    </p>
    <h2 id="core">Core Vaccination</h2>
    <p class="sub">
        Core vaccines are recommended for all pets with an unknown vaccination history, as they protect against diseases
        that infect dogs or cats of all life stages and lifestyles. The diseases involved have high rates of infection,
        pose a threat to the pet’s life, and/or are a danger to human health; in general, vaccination results in
        relatively good protection from the disease(s).<br><br>
        Here are some especially for dogs :
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Canine distemper—a highly contagious, potentially fatal viral disease that can affect the respiratory
            and nervous systems;
        </li>
        <li>
            Leptospirosis—a bacterial disease that is contracted through contact with contaminated urine and can
            cause liver and kidney failure. Can also be transmitted to people;
        </li>
        <li>
            Canine parvovirus—a highly contagious, potentially fatal gastrointestinal disease;
        </li>
        <li>
            and Adenovirus (hepatitis)—a viral disease that can affect multiple organ systems including the liver
            and kidneys and can be fatal.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="non-core">Non-core Vaccination</h2>
    <p class="sub">
        Non-core vaccines are optional vaccines that should be considered in light of the exposure risk of the animal
        (i.e., based on geographic distribution and the pet’s lifestyle). Several of the diseases involved are often
        self-limiting or respond readily to treatment.<br><br>
        Here are some especially for dogs :
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Canine parainfluenza virus—a highly contagious respiratory virus and is one of the most common pathogens
            of infectious tracheobronchitis;
        </li>
        <li>
            Canine influenza virus (CIV)—a highly contagious virus known to cause kennel cough;
        </li>
        <li>
            Leptospira spp—a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. Without treatment, can lead to kidney
            damage, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What should a dog owner do ?</h2>
    <p class="sub">Here are some suggestions: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Make sure your dog and puppies (especially those with a tenuous vaccination history) are vaccinated for
            all core diseases, including canine parvovirus, canine distemper, rabies and canine adenovirus.
        </li>
        <li>
            Puppies should receive a single dose of rabies vaccine either at 12 weeks of age, or 3 months. If you have
            an adult dog without any vaccination records, they should also get a rabies shot. All dogs should then get
            a booster one year later, and then every 3 years.
        </li>
        <li>
            As far as non-core vaccines go, the vets at UC Davis recommend that you consider such things as where you
            live and the exposure your pet faces. For example, Stone says, if you live in a high-risk environment for
            Lyme disease, vaccinate your dog. The same holds true for Bordetella. If your dog is not going to be
            kenneled, a vaccination is not necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the end, most animals need only their core vaccinations, and then boosters every three years thereafter.
        You should talk to your vet and decide whether and when a vaccination is needed. The days of treating all dogs
        as a monolith are long gone. Each pooch is different and should be treated as such.
