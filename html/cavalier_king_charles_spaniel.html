            Bred as a companion dog, this ‘toy’ breed nonetheless retains the sporty nature of their spaniel
            ancestors. If they’re not cuddled up beside you receiving pats, they’re equally as happy out flushing
            birds from bushes, tracking squirrels and even chasing butterflies! King Charles owners will attest to
            their enthusiastic and playful nature, with them often being described as ‘King of the tail-wagers’!
            Adaptable to apartment dwelling, they still need quite a bit of exercise to keep them content. A daily
            walk and some indoor ‘fetch’ games will suffice. They are also very dependent on human companionship so
            shouldn’t be left alone for too long. Separation anxiety in the King Charles can result in excessive
            whining, barking and destructive chewing. If socialised with other pets from an early age, they will be
            equally happy with an animal buddy around. Soft-tempered and eager to please, they respond well to
            training and are great around children. And, of course, those large expressive eyes would lighten even
            the darkest of moods!

            The King Charles is predisposed to some serious health conditions - potential hereditary weaknesses of
            the heart, liver, kidneys and blood circulatory system. As such, a high carbohydrate diet (kibble) is a
            particularly bad idea for this breed as it won’t give them sufficient preventative nutrition. We
            recommend you feed this royal canine with raw!
