            We’re delighted to see the Staffy come in so high on the Aussies’ favourites list! For too long,
            this breed has been terribly misunderstood and misrepresented. Before the mid-1800s, bloodsports such as
            bull baiting and bear baiting were popular. The Bull Terrier, as a fearless, tough and intensely loyal
            breed, was seen as ideal for such activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, they’ve had a bad rep due to their use as so-called ‘Pitbulls’ in dogfighting. But what
            people are finally realising (especially you, Australia!) is that these are human afflictions, not canine.
            They’re just eager to please their owners- some of whom have turned this desire to their own negative ends.
            To quote Cesar Milan, “In the 70s they blamed Dobermans, in the 80s they blamed German Shepherds, in the
            90s they blamed Rottweilers. Now they blame the Pit Bull. When will they blame the humans?”
        </p>

            In reality, the Staffy is friendly, enthusiastic and very affectionate - they make a really great
            companion dog and who can resist that classic Staffy smile! We know that many of the CDK9 Raw pack are
            Staffordshire Bull Terriers and that their loving and responsible owners are instrumental in helping
            change perceptions about this breed- we salute you!
