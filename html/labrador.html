            Originating from the coast of Newfoundland in Canada, this good-natured family favourite was trained to haul
            in fishing nets from the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Strong swimmers, athletic and with a fantastic
            sense of smell, their talents were recognised as a perfect fit as gundogs when they arrived in England in
            the early 19th century.

            These days, Labs are one of the most commonly used working dogs, with a wide range of roles. Hunting,
            tracking, detection, disability-assistance and therapy work are just some of the areas they excel in,
            with Labs being the most popular breed for guide dogs worldwide. They are also a wonderful companion dog
            and great around children. The fun begins from the very start: chocolate, black and yellows puppies can all
            come from the same litter! (“Labs are like a box of chocolates….”, anyone? Sorry!).

            While we here at CDK9 Raw adore seeing our pack members demolish our food, there’s just one word of
            caution; given the opportunity, Labs just won’t stop! It’s important to keep an eye on quantities because
            they are at risk of becoming overweight. Use our raw food calculator to make sure and give them a fishy
            treat now and again to bring them back to their roots!
