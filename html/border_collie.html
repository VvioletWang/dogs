            As the name suggests, this breed was developed on the English/Scottish border around 350 years ago.
            Widely regarded as the most intelligent of all dogs, they made their reputation as brilliant herders of
            livestock, particularly sheep. Their low-key approach, independence and intelligence makes them ideal for
            coaxing herds without causing stress to the animals. The behaviours they exhibit while doing so,
            such as stalking and crouching, are modified predatory instincts and actually very similar to how a wolf
            would approach its prey. This is the main reason they can herd with such precision.

            Of course, this drive to work means that the GSD needs to be kept active or else they can become
            mischievous. Good exercise and a consistent, challenging training routine will keep them physically
            and mentally stimulated, allowing you to reap the benefits of an adoring companion around the house.The
            Border Collie is a high-energy dog and capable of solving complex tasks independently. As such, they
            require lots of training from an early age to keep them stimulated and out of trouble! They pick up on
            inconsistency very quickly and can become easily bored. Once they have a strong and attentive owner,
            they are a joy to be around and will amaze with their cleverness.

           ‘Chaser’ the Border Collie is known as the ‘world’s smartest dog’. Raised by a university professor,
            Chaser is said to have the largest vocabulary of any dog, knowing over 1000 nouns, and the largest
            tested memory of any non-human animal! She’s not known as the Canine Einstein for nothing!
