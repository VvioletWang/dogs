            In at number 6 on the list is the Golden Retriever, traditionally a gundog beloved for their ability to
            retrieve game undamaged during hunting parties. They are smart, affectionate and good-natured and are one
            of those dogs that absolutely loves water! We don’t know about you, but we think there’s something
            so life-affirming at seeing the unbridled joy of a water dog in action! They have a water- repellent
            double coat that sheds, so a brush once a week is a good idea.

            The Golden Retriever remains enthusiastically puppy-like well into adulthood and is always up for adventure.
            Trustworthy around everyone, they are as honest a dog as you’re likely to find. They’re eager to please
            their owners and relatively easy to train, making them adaptable to almost any circumstance. Forgiving of
            inexperienced dog-owners, the Golden Retriever is a great first family dog. Their lust for life is wonderful
            to behold, but it’s important to instil good manners via obedience training from a young age. Once that’s
            done correctly, there’s really little else to worry about. A brisk daily walk and some games of fetch will
            ensure that your Golden Retriever sees you as number 1 in their world.
