        <p>
            Bred for their intelligence, the GSD consistently ranks near the top of the charts of the cleverest dogs.
            This makes them one of the favoured breeds for working around the world. They are often first choice for
            police and military work, as well as protection, disability assistance and search & rescue. Their
            exceptional trainability and obedience makes the German Shepherd one of the most versatile dogs around,
            excelling whatever the task.

            Of course, this drive to work means that the GSD needs to be kept active or else they can become
            mischievous. Good exercise and a consistent, challenging training routine will keep them physically
            and mentally stimulated, allowing you to reap the benefits of an adoring companion around the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GSD can be aloof and suspicious of strangers (making them a great kind of guard dog) so it’s important
            that they’re socialised around people and other animals from early puppy-hood.
