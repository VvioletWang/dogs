            Larger and heavier than their English cousins, the Amstaff emerged as a separate breed in the US and was
            first recognised by the AKC in 1898. Subjected to the same misconceptions and poor ownership as the Staffy,
            the Amstaff’s bigger size contributed to an unwarranted reputation as an intimidating fighting dog.
            Nothing could be further from the truth! Revised by the AKC in 1969 to their current name, generations of
            responsible breeding have created an Amstaff who is people-oriented and thrives as part of the family.
            Intensely loyal, they will protect their family from any threat but are otherwise low in aggression.
            Fun-loving and affectionate, the Amstaff loves snuggling up to its humans and snoozing away the hot days
            in the shade. They are strong-willed and can be boisterous so require a firm and patient owner who can
            deliver lots of training.

            Perhaps, best-suited to more confident and experienced dog-owners, a good training routine and enough
            exercise will result in one of the most loving dogs imaginable. Care should be taken around unfamiliar
            animals as the Amstaff may perceive them as a threat to their family. Early socialisation is key.
            As with their English cousins, we salute all those responsible owners who have ensured their reputation
            has improved so much that they’re now in the Top 10!
