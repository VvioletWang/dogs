        <h2 id="eyes">Eyes</h2>
        <p>
            A dog’s eyes, like a human’s, are capable of conveying a multitude of meanings and emotions. Here are
            common eye expressions:
        </p>
        <h3>Soft Eye Contact</h3>
            <img src="../images/soft_eye.jpg" alt="Two white dogs with soft eye contact." align="right">
            <p>
                This is a dog who is social, confident and friendly. The eyes are round or almond-shaped and soft,
                with the pupils dilated appropriately for available lighting (small pupils if light is bright, large
                if light is dim). Often accompanied by affiliate (distance decreasing) behavior such as a relaxed
                tail wag, and body curved or even wiggling.
            </p>
        <h3>Hard Eye Contact</h3>
            <img src="../images/hard_eye.jpg" alt="a white husky." align="right">
            <p>This is a hard, direct stare which, if you are good at reading dogs, gives you the chills. It is not
                friendly. The eyes are piercing, and there is often little or no body movement. Accompanying body
                language is usually assertive – dog is standing tall and forward, tail erect and still or wagging
                stiffly. May be part of a pre-aggression “freeze” where the dog goes completely still. If this
                warning is ignored, the dog is likely
                to bite.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Squinty Eyes</h3>
            <img src="../images/squinty_eye.jpg" alt="a brown dog with squinty eyes." align="right">
            <p>
                This is a sign of appeasement, which is often a good thing, if it is simply the dog’s nature to be
                appeasing. However, appeasement can also be a signal for fear, which is not such a good thing. If
                the dog is squinting and approaching, it’s a friendly, social expression, and it is probably safe
                to interact with him. If the dog is squinting with his body posture back and lowered, it is likely
                fear. If you approach he may feel threatened, and bite.
            </p>
        <h3>Avoiding Eye Contact</h3>
            <img src="../images/avoid_eye.jpg" alt="A bull terrier with green hat." align="right">
            <p>
                While the human species prizes direct eye contact as a measure of someone's character and honesty,
                in the dog world, direct eye contact can be perceived as a threat. Often, unless a dog has been
                strongly reinforced for making and keeping eye contact, he will look away when you look at him.
                It's a deference behavior – his way of saying he doesn't have any desire to challenge you. He's
                doing his best to be polite and non-confrontational.
            </p>
        <h3>Whale Eye</h3>
            <img src="../images/whale_eye.jpg" alt="A black pug" align="right">
            <p>
                This is a dog trainer term for when a dog shows the whites of his eyes. While it is often a warning
                sign and precursor to a bite, it really just means the dog is looking sideways while his nose is
                pointing forward. It is often seen with resource guarding because the dog is keeping his nose pointed
                at the valuable resource while watching you to gauge how much of a threat you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, the rest of the dog’s body language is key to knowing when whale eye is an aggression signal
                and when it is not. If the body is relatively still and forward, it’s aggression. If other body
                signals indicate relaxation and play, then it is likely not aggression.
            </p>

        <h2 id="ears">Ears</h2>
        <h3>Ears Relaxed</h3>
        <img src="../images/relaxed_ear.jpg" alt="A white labrador with relaxing ears" align="right">
        <p>
            For a prick-eared dog, the ears are still up and forward, but not hard forward, and may even swivel to
            the side. For a drop-eared dog, the ears are hanging flat against the side of the face instead of pulled
            forward. Relaxed ears generally mean a relaxed dog.
        </p>
        <h3>Ears Pulled Back</h3>
        <img src="../images/tense_ear.jpg" alt="A dog with tensed ears" align="right">
        <p>
            Regardless of ear style, ears that are pinned back against the head can mean one of several things. It
            can be happy appeasement, fear, or stress. As with the squinty eyes, the rest of the dog’s body
            language will give you clear clues as to which it is for the dog in front of you, and you can adjust
            your own interaction with the dog accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2 id="mouth">Mouth</h2>
        <h3>Relaxed Mouth</h3>
        <img src="../images/relaxed_mouth.jpg" alt="A labrador with relaxed mouth." align="right">
        <p>
            Your dog’s mouth, when relaxed should closed, or slightly open. If closed and relaxed, the skin
            around the mouth will be wrinkle-free, with possible exceptions for the wrinkly and bracycephalic
            (short-faced) breeds.
        </p>
        <h3>Panting</h3>
        <p>
            A dog can pant for several reasons. He may have just been exerting himself, and is panting to cool off.
            He may be overheated, in which case emergency cooling measures are called for to prevent heat stroke or
            even death. Or he may be stressed.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/panting.jpg" alt="A small dog is panting." align="right">
        <p>
            Again, evaluating the rest of his body language, as well as knowing what
            activities he’s been recently engaged in and taking into account the ambient temperature,will help you
            determine which panting is happening. Also, acute stress and distress panting is often very fast and
            shallow, as opposed to relaxed panting which is often slower and deeper.
        </p>
        <h3>Tense Mouth</h3>
        <img src="../images/tense_mouth.jpg" alt="A brown dog with tensed mouth." align="right">
        <p>
            If your dog’s mouth is relaxed and open, and he slowly closes it, his body goes still, and there
            are lines around his mouth, he is not happy. Use caution, especially if his body also goes still.
            This is often part of the freeze sequence that is the precursor to a bite.
        </p>
        <h3>Licking</h3>
        <img src="../images/licking.jpg" alt="A dog is licking its mouth." align="right">
        <p>
            Sometimes dogs lick to greet. Sometimes dogs do appeasement licking. Sometimes dogs lick their lips
            to get the last bits of flavor from the last tasty thing they ate. Sometimes dogs lick themselves
            persistently because of allergies or some other medical issue, or because of a canine compulsive
            disorder. And sometimes dogs lick their lips because they are stressed. Sometimes canine professionals
            have a tendency to overreact and call any lip-licking stress licking. It’s not necessarily. It might
            be. Let the rest of the dog’s body language help you decide if it is or it isn’t.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/yawn_mouth.jpg" alt="A dog is yawning." align="right">
        <h3>Yawning</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes dogs yawn because they are tired. Sometimes dogs yawn because yawning is contagious. Sometimes
            dogs yawn because they are stressed. Again, look at the whole dog – and then decide.
        </p>
        <h3>Snarl</h3>
        <img src="../images/snarl.jpg" alt="A golden dog snaring." align="right">
        <p>
            As clumsy as some people are at reading canine body language, this one is pretty hard to miss. When the
            lips curl up and all those shiny white fangs are exposed, the message is usually pretty clear. The snarl
            is usually accompanied by very hard eyes, while the ears may be pricked hard forward or pinned back,
            depending on whether the dog is being offensively or defensively aggressive.
        </p>

        <h2 id="facial_muscles">Facial Muscles</h2>
        <h3>Submissive Grin</h3>
        <img src="../images/submissive_grin.jpg" alt="An angry dog behind fence." align="right">
        <p>
            Often mistaken for a snarl, the submissive or appeasement grin is a bit of a mystery in canine
            communication. It is only seen very rarely in dog-dog interactions, but is not uncommon for dogs with
            soft, appeasing personalities to offer to humans. One theory is that the dogs are actually mimicking
            human smiles! At any rate, it’s a lovely behavior that can get dogs in trouble because people think
            they are being aggressive when they most certainly aren’t. If you’re not sure, quickly check the rest
            of the dog's body language to clues as to which it really is. I say “quickly” because if it really is
            a snarl, prompt evasive action may be required on your part.
        </p>
        <h3>Lack of Brow Lines (calm)</h3>
        <img src="../images/dog-eyes.jpeg" alt="Upper face of a dog." align="right">
        <p>
            A calm, relaxed dog’s brow is as smooth as a baby’s bottom (again, with those wrinkly-dog exceptions).
            On the contrary, it will look like frown.
        </p>
        <h3>Mouth Lines</h3>
        <img src="../images/mouth_line.jpg" alt="A brown dog." align="right">
        <p>
            You can also see tension in the lines around your dog’s mouth. A relaxed dog’s lips are flat and
            wrinkle-free.
